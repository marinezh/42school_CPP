// public
// Everything marked as public is visible and accessible from anywhere (inside the class, outside the class, in main, etc.).
// Typically, you put the methods (functions) here that you want users of the class to call.

// private
// Everything marked as private is hidden from the outside. Only the class itself can access it.
// Usually, you put the data members (variables) here so they cannot be changed directly from outside the class.

// protected (youâ€™ll meet it later when studying inheritance)
// Works like private, but derived (child) classes can also access it.

// Why this is useful

// Encapsulation â†’ You hide the internal details of how the class works. Users only see the interface (the public part).

// Safety â†’ Prevents outside code from accidentally changing or breaking the internal state.

// Clean interface â†’ Users of the class donâ€™t need to know how it works internally, only how to use it.

// ðŸ‘‰ In short:

// private = hidden inside.

// public = open to everyone.

// protected = for the class itself and its children.
